# BrightSteps

[License: GPL-3.0-only](LICENSE)

BrightSteps is a calm, visual-first learning app for autistic kids and their families. It is designed to be local-first in Phase 1, with no required accounts, so families and educators can run learning sessions privately and reliably.

## Not Medical Advice

BrightSteps is an educational support tool only. It is not a medical device, and it does not provide diagnosis, therapy, or medical advice.

## Install and Run

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

## Content Packs

BrightSteps uses JSON content packs for learning modules. Packs are schema-validated and designed to work offline/local-first once loaded.
